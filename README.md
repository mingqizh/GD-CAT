# GD-CAT
`GD-CAT`is a shiny-based endocrine genetic web app for tissue cross-talking. 
You can select the gene and tissue combination that interests you, and have a look at the demographic characteristics from the cohort of choice.
and then do the enrichment, scatter plot, single cell and network visualization.  <br><br>
You can access our app via [GD-CAT](https://pipeline.biochem.uci.edu/gtex/demo2/).<br><br>
Now the [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37214953/) is preprint.<br><br>
## Tutorial 
### Initial settings
First start from the dashboard. Select the sex that you want and input an NBCI gene symbol, or you will see a pop-up warning. Hit the "process data" button after choosing a tissue. A progress bar will show at the bottom right of the screen. <br><br>
After the processing of the original data, you can see the pie chart where the gene is enriched in, age and sex of the cohort, cell type, and top genes. <br><br>
### Enrichment Analysis
To generate the enrichment analysis of the second part, users should click the pie chart body to select a tissue and threshold first. Your choice will be displayed then in this section. Then users can hit the "Start Analysis" button to see the results. <br><br>
### Scatter Plot
Same as the initial settings, make sure you put an official NBCI gene symbol here. <br><br>
### Network Analysis
Move the slider bars to custom the gene numbers for within and peripheral tissue and then process the analysis. <br><br>
#### Attention
All the images plus some of the data that generate them can be downloaded. <br><br>
You should hit the button again to update your settings.
